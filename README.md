## 1. High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

Task: Write a query to find customers with at least one funded savings plan AND one funded investment plan, sorted by total deposits.
Tables:
users_customuser
savings_savingsaccount
plans_plan

## 2. Transaction Frequency Analysis
Scenario: The finance team wants to analyze how often customers transact to segment them (e.g., frequent vs. occasional users).
Task: Calculate the average number of transactions per customer per month and categorize them:
"High Frequency" (≥10 transactions/month)
"Medium Frequency" (3-9 transactions/month)
"Low Frequency" (≤2 transactions/month)
Tables:
users_customuser
savings_savingsaccount

## 3. Account Inactivity Alert
Scenario: The ops team wants to flag accounts with no inflow transactions for over one year.
Task: Find all active accounts (savings or investments) with no transactions in the last 1 year (365 days) .
Tables:
plans_plan
savings_savingsaccount

				
## 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
Scenario: Marketing wants to estimate CLV based on account tenure and transaction volume (simplified model).
Task: For each customer, assuming the profit_per_transaction is 0.1% of the transaction value, calculate:
Account tenure (months since signup)
Total transactions
Estimated CLV (Assume: CLV = (total_transactions / tenure) * 12 * avg_profit_per_transaction)
Order by estimated CLV from highest to lowest
